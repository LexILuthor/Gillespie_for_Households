# Gillespie_for_Households with beta variable
Gillespie algorithm implemented for a network divide into households randomly connected
The value of beta changes when more than 10% of the population is recovered (this is to simulate a lockdown). We use the recovered because usally the number of death is proportional to the number of recovered
